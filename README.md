# Sieve Out of Office Addon for Thunderbird

This is primarily a project from Trustedbird/Milimail who appear to have stopped supporting it a couple of years ago.

Their original project pages are:

* http://adullact.net/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/milimail/index.php/Trustedbird_Project
* http://www.trustedbird.org/
* http://adullact.net/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/milimail/index.php/Out_of_Office
* https://adullact.net/anonscm/git/milimail/milimail.git


We ([Open Solutions](http://www.opensolutions.ie/) have fixed a significant number of bugs to make it work
with Thunderbird 17 and can confirm that it is working with Dovecot Sieve (2.1.7).


It was and continues to be released under *MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1*.
