# Sieve Out of Office Addon for Thunderbird

This is primarily a project from Trustedbird/Milimail who appear to have stopped supporting it a couple of years ago.

Their original project pages are:

* http://www.trustedbird.org/
* http://adullact.net/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/milimail/index.php/Out_of_Office
* https://adullact.net/anonscm/git/milimail/milimail.git

[Open Solutions](http://www.opensolutions.ie/) has fixed a significant number of bugs to make it work
with Thunderbird 17 and could confirm that it was working with Dovecot Sieve (2.1.7) but don't seem to develop it any further either.

This repository represents our [Gorilla Computing](http://www.gorilla-computing.de/) attempt to make the plugin work again with recent versions of Thunderbird and Dovecot Sieve.

It was and continues to be released under *MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1*.
